# Team Fortress 2 Gamemode
The source code for the Team Fortress 2 Gamemode.

================ Workshop Description ===

IF YOU HAVE ANY OF ADDONS SOMETIMES EVEN 1 WILL BREAK THE GAMEMODE

  The Gamemode that allows you to play TF2 in Gmod!

          Pre-Owners - Kilburn, wango911
           Workshopper - Agent Agrimar

If you're wondering why _Kilburn ended the development was because he had a hard drive failure and lost all his data. I was in talks with some other dude in regards to bringing back the gamemode, but I have not talked to the guy in months, so I'm guessing his branch is dead. - [N⁸] SmileyFace (A.K.A wango911)
